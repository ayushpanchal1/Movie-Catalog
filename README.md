<h1>What is Moviebased?</h1><br>
        <p>Moviebased is a university project.</p><br>
        <p>Made by students Ayush Panchal, Piyush Pingalkar, Dhiraj Pandit and Kushalraj Pandey; the project involves learning REST API 
            framework and testing/implementing IMDB API.</p><br>
        <h1>Why APIs?</h1><br>
        <p>We decided to learn REST APIs as APIs are the future. (or even present at this point)</p><br>
        <p>Most monolithic projects now use micro services to ease up production and development, we feel that API knowledge is crucial 
            in current day web development.</p><br>
