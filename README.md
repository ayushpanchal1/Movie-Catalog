<h1>What is Moviebased?</h1><br>
        <p>Moviebased is a Movie Catalog/Database that provides new, upcoming and trending movies with reviews and ratings generated by users on IMDB.<br>
                <p>It is our Second Year university project.</p><br>
        <p>Made by students Ayush Panchal, Piyush Pingalkar, Dhiraj Pandit and Kushalraj Pandey of KJSIT; the project involves learning REST API 
            framework and testing/implementing IMDB API.</p><br>
        <h1>Why APIs?</h1><br>
        <p>We decided to learn REST APIs as APIs are the future.</p><br>
        <p>Most monolithic projects now use micro services to ease up production and development, we feel that API knowledge is crucial 
            in current day web development.</p><br>
        <h1>Where can I get IMDB API?</h1><br>
        <p> You can get the API <a href="https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a> on rapidAPI. It contains documentation and example responses too.</p><br>
